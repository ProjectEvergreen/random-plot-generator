# random-plot-generator
An example of using SVG and Custom Elements (with `lit-html`) to create data visualizations and other fun things in JavaScript.  Inspired by [this FunFunFunction YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeGmPpG8tAaqSmf3k56LPwiF) on creating a Neural Network in JavaScript.  For the time being I will just be emulating what's done in the video, but where it goes from there, who knows!

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run serve`

## Contributing
The more the merrier!  Would love to keep this going with more varied and interesting features and visualizations.  Propose something in the issue tracker and feel free to submit a PR!
